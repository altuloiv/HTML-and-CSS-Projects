HTML-AND-CSS PROJECTS
This is the README File going over the projects I have done in my HTML-CSS Course.

Projects:
- The Cheese Station Website
- Academy Cinema Website
- One-Page HTML Website
- Portfolio Website.

The Cheese Station Website
    The Cheese Station Website was where I really learned how to move images and style them with a border
    and animation effects. It is also where I learned more about the "CSS BOX," utilizing margins and 
    paddings to get the desired look I want. 

Academy Cinema Website
    The Academy Cinema Website is where I got to learn how to utilize bootstrap4 into making a website.
    This project showed me how to edit and change different elements using bootstrap 'commands' to style
    the website exactly how I want it. 

One-Page HTML Website
    The One-Page HTML Website was the first project where I was truly set loose to "figure it out" and create
    a one page website to demonstrate some of the things I learned in the course. This website I made a small 
    about page for you personal YouTube channel.

Portfolio Website
    This project was the last for the course. This project mainly was to utilize CSS into styling my own portfolio
    website that will be used in later courses to add to my portfolio.
